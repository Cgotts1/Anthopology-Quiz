# Anthropology-Quiz

This project is titled "Anthropology Quiz!" and is an application users may refer to when testing their knowledge of various concepts within the field of Anthropology. To start the quiz, the user must click the Start Quiz button which will then initiate a 75 second timer and a series of quiz questions. After every question, the quiz will let it show whether a user's answer was correct or wrong underneath the following question. If wrong, the timer decreases by 10 seconds. The game is over when the timer reaches 0 or the series of questions come to an end. Users can then type in their names to submit their score(the final time) so it can be recorded in the HiScores page. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were needed to create this application. Selectors in CSS were used to hide certain classes in html while JavaScript functions were used to reveal/create different html elements.
